## Plots
The following plots are contained in this folder: SameChromVsRandomDistances.pdf and AdjVsAnyBlocksDistances.pdf

The first plot is a comparison of the RF distances between trees estimated from different alignments of the same chromosome in each plant strain versus the RF distances between pairs of random trees, which are distributed as a linear function of a Poisson random variable. 

The second plot is a comparison of (a random sample of) the RF distances between all pairs of trees estimated from different alignments of the same chromosome versus only the RF distances between trees estimated from adjacent alignments of the same chromosome.
