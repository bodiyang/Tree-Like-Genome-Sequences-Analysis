See:
- [overview](overview.md) of the project: learning goals,
  group work, and overview of tasks and pipeline
- [step by step](stepsinstructions.md) instructions.

Now delete these lines and replace by your own "readme"
to document your pipeline.
Your result summary should go in a different markdown file,
`report.md`.

## Task 2
The file should work for downloading. We still need to (see TODOs in file)
1. Do analysis of the log.out file to add to the report.
2. Confirm all files are downloading correctly.
3. There may be a way to use one curl command instead of a for loop, which would probably be more efficient

I included a commented out line that only downloads a small subset (15 of the 216) of the files for testing. The comments indicate what lines need to be (un)commented to use this.
